In case of installers which happen to occur in framework module/plugin systems or in composer installer/plugins
there is the need for moving files from one location to another one.

This can be a basic mapping of one path to another one.
It also can be a complete mapping of every single file, like in case of pears package.xml format.
It also can be something special as the modman format, which describes something glob like,
like used for the cli cp command.
